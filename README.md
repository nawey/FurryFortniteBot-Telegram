# FurryFortniteBot-Teleram
Telegram bot to autopost the curated item shop to its own dedicated channel, the autopost future is in an opt-in basis witht the command /register, at the moment this one is working for group chats and personal interactions with the bots, in the future I plan to add support for channels.

There is also the option to check the items currently available with a command to check at any moment of the day the same information. 

if you want to add it to your group chat please do! The bot is up and running at the following url.
